## Goal
Create the "Music" page to display albums and singles, fetching data from the SQLite database.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `app/music/page.tsx`.

    - [ ] Use **ShadCN AspectRatio** (1:1) for album art.
    - [ ] Display album artwork and title.
    - [ ] Add a **ShadCN Button** (Play icon) to start playing in the global player.
- [ ] Fetch tracks from the database, grouped by album/single.
- [ ] Implement a grid layout for releases.
- [ ] Create a detailed view (or expand-in-place) to show the tracklist (use **ShadCN Table** for tracklist).
- [ ] Use **ShadCN Skeleton** for loading states.
- [ ] Use **ShadCN HoverCard** for track credits/info.
