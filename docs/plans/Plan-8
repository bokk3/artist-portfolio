# Plan 8: Blog System (Frontend)

## Goal
Implement the public-facing blog section with a card layout and rich text rendering.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `app/blog/page.tsx` to list all published posts.
- [ ] Create `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` for single post view.
- [ ] Create a `BlogCard` component.
- [ ] Implement a function to estimate reading time from content length.
- [ ] Add social share buttons (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp) to the single post page.
- [ ] Render rich text content safely (using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with sanitization or a parser).
