# Plan 4: Music Player & Waveform Integration

## Goal
Implement the persistent audio player with waveform visualization using WaveSurfer.js.

## Tasks
- [ ] Install `wavesurfer.js`.
- [ ] Create a `PlayerContext` to manage global playback state.
- [ ] Create a `Player` component fixed at the bottom:
    - [ ] Use `glass-panel` utility from `theme-colors.css`.
    - [ ] Use **ShadCN Slider** for volume control.
    - [ ] Use **ShadCN Button** (ghost/icon variant) for controls.
    - [ ] Add **ShadCN Tooltip** for control hints.
    - [ ] Mobile: Use **ShadCN Drawer** for the full-screen player view.
- [ ] Integrate WaveSurfer.js to render waveforms.
- [ ] Ensure the player continues playing when navigating between pages.
- [ ] Add a "Now Playing" indicator.
