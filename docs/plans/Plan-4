# Plan 4: Music Player & Waveform Integration

## Goal
Implement the persistent audio player with waveform visualization using WaveSurfer.js.

## Tasks
- [ ] Install `wavesurfer.js`.
- [ ] Create a `PlayerContext` to manage global playback state (current track, isPlaying, volume).
- [ ] Create a `Player` component that stays fixed at the bottom of the screen.
- [ ] Implement play/pause, next/prev, and volume controls.
- [ ] Integrate WaveSurfer.js to render waveforms for the current track.
- [ ] Ensure the player continues playing when navigating between pages (Next.js App Router handles this if layout is persistent).
- [ ] Add a "Now Playing" indicator in the navbar or tab title.
